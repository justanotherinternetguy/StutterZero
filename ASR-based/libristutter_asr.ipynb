      "they were three plates late so the Marilla must be expecting someone home with Matthew 2T but the dishes for everyday dishes and there was only Crabapple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company\n",
      "he was actually stricken dumb for 5 it was on supposable that Marilla was making fun of her but misses Rachel was almost forced to supposed are you in Earnest Marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course\n",
      "it doesn't really seem as if I must be dreaming while I'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake Matthew Marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier than his own grandfather\n",
      "so in the end we decided to ask mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by Richard Spencer's Folks at Carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about 10 or 11 we decided that would be the best date\n",
      "this job's comforting seems knighted to offend North Woodlawn Amarillo she needs it steadily on I don't deny there's something in what you say Rachel I've had some qualms but Matthew was terrible set on it I could see that so I gave in\n",
      "so Matthew went to Bright River to meet him mrs. Spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to White Sands station herself message Rachel prided herself and always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak and now having a justed her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news\n",
      "he was the shortest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk Matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving a buggy with something that didn't happen often misses Rachel Honda she might could make nothing of it\n",
      "but mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing Circle\n",
      "barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so socially situated mrs. Lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just saying that's what she said as she stepped along the Deep record grassy Lane\n",
      "ordered with wild bushes it's no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees are too much company so do your nose if they were there be enough of them I'd rather look at people to be sure\n",
      "once you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left Orchard and nodding slender Birches down in the hollow by the Brook was Green Dover by a tangle of vines here's that Marilla Cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine\n",
      "I got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his Homestead Green Gables was built at the farthest Edge it is cleared land and there it was to this day\n",
      "mrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with important orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert bells and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none\n",
      "as if poisoning Wells were feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy I'd never dream of taking a girl to bring I wonder if mrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it but they're she wouldn't ring from adopting a whole orphan Asylum if she took it into her head\n",
      "I'm mrs. Rachel dearly love to make a sensation so she herself away somewhat to Murillo's for leave for the latter felt her doubts and fears Reviving under the influence of mrs. Rachel's pessimism of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated mrs. Rachel when she was safely out in the lane\n",
      "and here she sat now missing and the table behind her was late for supper mrs. Rachel before she had fairly close the door\n",
      "or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its Windows looked east and west through the West one looking out on the backyard flood of mellow June sunlight but the East 1\n",
      "Murillo's lips twitched understandingly she had expected message Rachel up she had known that the side of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbors curiosity oh no I'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday she said\n",
      "old enough to be of some use and doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we need to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from mrs. Alexander Spencer today the mailman brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight\n",
      "Peter had asked him if course for Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was Matthew Cuthbert at half past 3 on the afternoon of a busy day possibly driving over the Halo and up the hill\n",
      "and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty people in Avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbors business by dint of neglecting their own\n",
      "anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that Hill Road and so run the Unseen Gauntlet of mrs. Rachel's all seeing eye she was sitting one afternoon in early June the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright\n",
      "mrs. Rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morris in the evening before in William J Blair store over at Carmody that he meant to so his trying to feed the next afternoon\n",
      "Matthew went to Bright River getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming down the train tonight if Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished\n",
      "it had its source away back in the woods the old Cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong broken its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and Cascade but by the time it reached lintahlo it was a quiet well-conducted little stream\n",
      "it seems uncanny to think a child of Green Gables somehow there's never been one there for Matthew and Marilla we're grown when the new house was build if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them I wouldn't be in that orphan shoes for anyting\n",
      "only don't say I didn't warn you if you Burns Green Gables down or put strychnine in the well I heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan Asylum child did that and the whole family died and fearful Agony only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl to Amarillo\n",
      "they seem contented enough but then I suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even being hanged as the Irishman said with this mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green Gables very green and neat and precise with that yard\n",
      "the Guerrilla I just getting boys from Orphan asylums in Nova Scotia were part of the spring work on any well-regulated Avonlea Farm instead of being an unheard-of innovation mrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought an!\n",
      "there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half-grown little French boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's and off to the Lobster canneries are the states that first Matthew suggested getting a homeboy but I said no flat to that\n",
      "how are all your folks something that for lack of Any Other Name might be friendship existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and mrs. Rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their two similarity at all\n",
      "and then Nova scotia's right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from England or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well I hope it will turn out alright to mrs. Rachel limit on that plane the indicated her painful doubts\n",
      "get something must have happened since last night to start him off I'm clean puzzled that's what and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until I know what is taking Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today accordingly after T mrs. Rachel said out she had not far to go\n",
      "if you run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more\n",
      "they may be all right I'm not saying they're not but no London Street Arabs for me I said give me a native-born at least they'll be a risk no matter who we get but I'll feel easier in my mind and sleep Sounder at night if we get a boring Canadian\n",
      "could have eaten a meal off the ground without overburdening the proverbial peck of dirt mrs. Rachel rap smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bitten to do so the kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful apartment\n",
